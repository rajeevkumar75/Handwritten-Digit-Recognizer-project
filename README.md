# Handwritten Digit Recognizer (TensorFlow/Keras)

Link: https://rajeevkumar75-handwritten-digit-recognizer-project-app-uxx0ad.streamlit.app/

🔹 Project Overview

This project is a Handwritten Digit Recognition System built using TensorFlow and Streamlit.
It leverages the MNIST dataset containing 70,000 images of handwritten digits (0–9).
The model uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to automatically classify digits from images with high accuracy.

🚀 Problem Statement

Manual recognition of handwritten digits (e.g., in forms, bank cheques, and surveys) is time-consuming and error-prone.
This project demonstrates how Deep Learning can automate the process, improve accuracy, and reduce human effort.

🎯 Features

✅ Built with TensorFlow/Keras CNN
✅ Achieves ~98% accuracy on MNIST test data
✅ Interactive Streamlit web app for real-time predictions
✅ Users can upload images or use sample test cases
✅ Beautiful & simple UI for better visualization
✅ Predictions displayed with confidence scores
