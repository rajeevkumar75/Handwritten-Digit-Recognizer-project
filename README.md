# 🖊️ Handwritten Digit Recognizer

A deep learning project that recognizes handwritten digits (0–9) from images using **TensorFlow** and **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**.  
Built with **Python** and deployed with **Streamlit** for an interactive user interface.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement
Manual recognition of handwritten digits is **time-consuming** and **error-prone**, especially when processing large datasets like scanned forms or bank checks.  
This project automates the process by training a CNN model on the **MNIST dataset**, achieving high accuracy in classifying handwritten digits.

---

## 🎯 Project Goals
- Train a deep learning model (CNN) to classify digits (0–9).  
- Achieve **>98% accuracy** on test data.  
- Provide an **interactive Streamlit app** where users can test predictions in real-time.  

---

## ⚙️ Features
✅ Load and preprocess the MNIST dataset  
✅ Build a CNN model with TensorFlow/Keras  
✅ Train & validate the model with high accuracy  
✅ Predict digits from new unseen images  
✅ User-friendly **Streamlit Web App** with drawing & example predictions
